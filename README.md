# halite-bot
This is my https://halite.io bot developed during Two Sigma's internal summer programming contest in 2016.

By the end of the TS internal competition I was struggling with anti-overkill tactics and didn't succeed to implement it before the TS finals.

I submitted my final bot to the Halite Open contest. Surprisingly, it finished better than I expected at 19th, but the top 10 players pushed the game much further. The difference between #1 and #19 is immense.
